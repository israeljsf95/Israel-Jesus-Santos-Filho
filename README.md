Hello everyone and welcome! I am Israel and I am currently finishing my Electronic Engineer Degree at the Federal University of Sergipe!
I am an integrant of Biochaves Research Group as a Undergraduated Researcher on the fields: Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition

### My Research Group Theme:
    If everything create by nature can be treated as signals, and with math we can understand signals, everything can be understandable with the right eye and the right math.
    Everything is signal (image, audio (voice and music), text, DNA Sequence ...)!!!

#### üåê Things that I am doing and Research Interests:
- *Finishing my Degree* ü•≥ 
- Research and Developing Image Processing Techniques for automatic landmark identification at bee wings
- Research on Context Modeling 
- Research on Voice and Musical Signal Analysis
- Math behind Deep Learining Models as a devote to the Manifold Hypothesis!!!
- Research Interests: 
  - Signal Processing, Applied Math, Data Mining, Image Processing, Audio Processing, 
    NLP, Deep Learning - Math and Models, Numerical Methods, Mathematical Modelling,
    Computational Fluid Dynamics, Feature Extraction and Generation, Machine Learning,
    BioMedical Engineering, Information Theoretical Learning and Dimensionality Reduction.
    
#### üë®‚Äçüéì Research Achievements:
(publications on my research gate)
- National Publication on IX ENCOM: Confer√™ncia Nacional em Comunica√ß√µes, Redes e Seguran√ßa da Informa√ß√£o (2019)
- International Publication on INTERSPEECH (2020)
- Special Student of the Pos Graduate Programming on Electric Engineer of Federal University of Sergipe: 
  - Taked as Graded: Computer Vision (A grade), Non Linear Systems Analysis (A grade), Modeling and Simulation (B grade)
  - Taked as Listener: Graph Theory, Speaker Recognition, Stochastic Simulation and Electronic Instrumentation.
- Visitor Student Research Program at KAUST (King Abdullah University of Science and Technology) - May 2020 ~ February 2021 - Working on a novel algorithm based on quantum physics to do denoising and feature extraction/generation on pulsed shaped signals.
  

#### üíª Tools (Programming Languages are just tools too) that I know:

-  Matlab / Scilab
-  Python
-  C / C++ (embedded development based on PIC and DSPIC architectures, also Arduino and STM32 (very few experience on the last one))
-  Verilog (XIILINX FPGA)
-  SQL
